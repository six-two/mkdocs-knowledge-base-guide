# MkDocs plugins

In my opinion one of the greatest strengths of MkDocs is its extensability using plugins.
There is a big and growning list of plugins available.
And if what you are looking for is missing (and not a complex problem), you can write a custom hook that implements it or ask ChatGPT/Phind to write it for you.

The following pages detail plugins I find helpful, but there are many more available at <https://github.com/mkdocs/catalog>.
The best plugin in my opinion is the [Material for MkDocs theme](material.md), which is basically a plugin collection in itself bundled with a great looking theme.
It is the most popular plugin and for example also used by [OWASP Cheat Sheets](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/index.html) and quite a few other sites I have seen in the wild.
It improves many features of MkDocs, including the search.

@TODO quick installation and usage?
