This plugin allows you to search only your code listings for specific works or substrings.
It can also show you all your code listings on a single page.
I wrote it after the normal search stopped being accurate after my knowledge base grew too much.

## Configuration

Add plugin to `mkdocs.yml`
```yaml
plugins:
- extract_listings
    javascript_search_file: assets/js/listing-search-plugin.js
```

On the page where you want to use the code search function, define an element with the id `listing-extract-search` and load the script file generated by the plugin:
```html
<div id="listing-extract-search"></div>
<script src="/assets/js/listing-search-plugin.js">
```

## Demo

Below is a version of it in action:

<div id="listing-extract-search"></div>
<script src="/assets/js/listing-search-plugin.js">
