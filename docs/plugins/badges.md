The plugin allows you creating badges like the ones above this line.
I wrote it to make it easy how to install specific tools.
There is a simple syntax for making badges like the above ones:

```markdown
I|pypi|mkdocs-badges|
I|github|six-two/mkdocs-badges|
L|Documentation|https://mkdocs-badges.six-two.dev/|
```

You can find more information in the plugin's [documentation](https://mkdocs-badges.six-two.dev/).
