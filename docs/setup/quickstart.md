This is designed to get you up and running as quick as possible.

1. Install mkdocs:
    ```bash
    pip install mkdocs
    ```
2. Create a new mkdocs project:
    ```bash
    mkdocs new .
    ```
3. Remove `docs/index.md` and copy your notes into the `docs` directory.
4. Serve the site with mkdocs to see if it looks ok.
5. Optional: Improve the site by adding plugins, themes, updating `mkdocs.yml`, etc.
6. Deploy the site.
    For example by building it with `mkdocs build` and uploading the `site` directory to your server's webroot.
